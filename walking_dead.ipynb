Come home, house all lit up, and my job, apparently because… because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.\", 'Rick: Is that right?', \"Shane: Yeah, baby. Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching to you now, boy.\", 'Rick smiles.', 'Shane: The same chick, mind ya. She\\'ll bitch about global warming.

Anyway, uh… Polite version… Still man, that… that earns me this. This look and loathing you would not believe. And that\\'s when the exorcist voice pops out. \"You sound just like my damn father.

On the other side on the floor is a dead woman that is missing her abdomen and her entrails are hanging out of her stomach. Disgusted, Rick continues down the wall. He sees bullet holes and blood stains on the walls and walks toward a door that says, \"Don\\'t open, Dead Inside.\" When he approaches it, the door starts to push open but the lock and board that was placed on it prevents it from opening. Hands that look pale and dirty reach out to try to get at Rick, but he runs away from it. He tries to get inside the elevator, but it isn\\'t working.

Walls haven’t been breached in well over a month, we haven’t suffered a casualty in the inside since early winter.', 'Andrea: How’s that possible?', 'The woman: Our governor’s set a strict curfew.

My team grabbed whatever supplies and vehicles we could abandoned our post.', 'He coughs, the doctor gives him water, then leaves.', 'The governor: How many of you escaped?', 'Pilot: Maybe it was ten in my group.

(Milton shows the Governor the walker whose head Michonne cut off before, the one she was carrying with them) What do you make of it?', 'Milton: Oh, pretty impressive, really. Major kudos for ingenuity. You take away their arms so they can’t grab, you take away their jaws so they can’t bite. Take away their ability to eat, they lose interest in doing so. They’re no longer in attack mode, you can be in their presence without threat. They become… docile, in a sense.', 'The governor: Lurkers.', 'Milton: Mmh, docile. Or lurkers, you know? Whatever you like…', 'The governor: Why keep ‘em?', 'Milton: Ah, repellent.', 'The governor: Camouflage. (he puts his finger in the walker’s mouth) Walk with the biters, they think you’re a biter. Low profile, that’s smart. (Milton nods) They’re still pretty thin.

He holds a small fuel tank in his hand trying to look for some fuel. He walks past several vehicles where decomposing dead people sit in their cars with flies buzzing around them. He walks towards the gas station and sees that the sign says \\u2018No Gas'. He starts to walk back towards his car but he hears some footsteps. He kneels down and looks under a car. He sees a small girl walking toward a teddy bear. She is in a night gown and some slippers. She picks it up and starts walking away from Rick.\", \"Rick: Little girl? I'm a policeman. Little girl.\", \"She stops.\", \"Rick: Don't be afraid. Okay? Little girl.\", \"When she turns around, we see that she is a walker with missing parts of her cheek.

They're born thinking in a switch, it only goes one way. On. They're struck blind the second they leave a room. I mean every woman, I ever let have a key... I swear to God. Come home, house all lit up, and my job, apparently because\\u2026 because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.\", \"Rick: Is that right?\", \"Shane: Yeah, baby. Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching to you now, boy.\", \"Rick smiles.\", \"Shane: The same chick, mind ya. She'll bitch about global warming. That's when Reverend Shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say \\\"Um, darling? maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see, goes both ways, \\\"maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming.\\\"\", \"Rick: You say that?\", \"Shane: Yeah. Anyway, uh\\u2026 Polite version\\u2026 Still man, that\\u2026 that earns me this. This look and loathing you would not believe.

Always, always yelling about the power bill, telling me to turn off the damn lights.\\\"\", \"Rick: What do you say to that?\", \"Shane: You know what I wanna say. I wanna say, \\\"Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch?

Do you share your feelings and that kind of stuff?\", \"Rick: The thing is\\u2026 lately whenever I try\\u2026 everything I say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all.

Make sure you got a round in the chamber and your safety off.\", \"Leon realizes he didn't do that and corrects his mistake. \", \"Shane: Would be kind of cool to get on one of them shows.\", \"Suddenly, the car comes down the road. It hits the spike strips dead on and ends up crashing after flipping multiple times.\", \"Rick: Holy sh1t.\", \"The deputies aim all of their guns at the men inside the car. The driver's door opens and he comes out with a gun. \", \"Policeman: Gun, gun, gun.\", \"Rick: Put it down! Put the gun down!\", \"But the man comes out firing.

You probably could tell, hmm? I'll just set this on your side table, ok?\", \"Shane sits them on the drawer next to the bed.

I hope you left her that spoon collection. Shane?\", \"He looks over on the table and sees that the flowers are dead and dried out. \", \"Rick: Shane, you in the john?\", \"He pulls one off and it falls apart in his hands. Over on the wall, the clock has stopped at 2:16. Rick is confused and he decides to get out of the bed. He is very weak from not having any food or water as well as his injury. He falls out of the bed and onto the floor.\", \"Rick: Nurse, help. Nurse. Help!\", \"Rick calls for the nurse, but nobody answers. Rick gets up on his own and heads into the bathroom. He gets the water running and takes a long drink.\", \"Hallways \\u2013 Hospital\", \"Rick leaves his room and finds that the lights are flickering in the hallways. There are several overturned beds and papers laying everywhere. Rick shuffles down the hallways. He comes to a desk and picks up the phone, but he is unable to get a dial tone. In one of the bins, he finds a pack of matches. He picks it up and lights one to make sure it works. He continues to walk down the dark hallway and looks through a door. On the other side on the floor is a dead woman that is missing her abdomen and her entrails are hanging out of her stomach. Disgusted, Rick continues down the wall. He sees bullet holes and blood stains on the walls and walks toward a door that says, \\\"Don't open, Dead Inside.\\\" When he approaches it, the door starts to push open but the lock and board that was placed on it prevents it from opening. Hands that look pale and dirty reach out to try to get at Rick, but he runs away from it. He tries to get inside the elevator, but it isn't working. He runs into the stairwell, but it is dark inside. He lights several matches and walks down. Rick finally reaches the bottom and goes outside into the light.\", \"Outside\", \"As he walks down into the back parking lot, Rick sees hundreds of bodies that are all strewn across the parking lot. They have been wrapped in body bags and Rick is disgusted by the sight of the dead bodies and flies buzzing around them. Rick walks up an embankment where there is a helicopter, military tents and vehicles set up. The place has been destroyed and abandoned. \", \"Street\", \"Rick walks down a street and finds a bicycle. He picks it up and notices a mutilated corpse near it. When he moves the bike, the corpse actually turns on him. It's a dead woman that is missing her legs. She crawls towards Rick, but he jumps on the bike and rides away. He reaches his house and starts running around yelling for Lori and Carl.\", \"Rick: Lori! Lori! Carl! Carl! Lori! Carl!\", \"They are nowhere to be found and Rick falls onto the ground sobbing.\", \"Rick: Lori! Carl!\", \"He starts to panic.\", \"Rick: Is this real? Am I here?\", \"He starts to smack himself.\", \"Rick: Wake, wake up!\", \"He walks out onto the steps of his house and sits down in frustration. He has no idea how to take all of this in. He looks over and sees a man walking down the street. Rick stares at him, confused, and starts to motion for him to come over. Someone comes up behind Rick. He turns around to take a shovel to the face. Duane, a kid, has hit Rick.\", \"Duane: Daddy, daddy!\", \"Rick: Carl\\u2026 Carl? I found you\\u2026\", \"Rick calls Duane by the name of Carl thinking that it's his son.\", \"Duane: Daddy, I got this sumbitch.

Did you get bit?\", \"Rick: Bit?\", \"Morgan: Bit. Chewed. Maybe scratch? Anything like that.\", \"Rick: No, I got shot.\", \"Morgan: Just shot?\", \"Rick: As far as I know. Hey\\u2026 Just let me\\u2026\", \"Morgan feels his forehead.\", \"Morgan: Feels cooler now.
